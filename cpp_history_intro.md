# C++: Language History and Getting Started

## History of C++

### What is the name of the language?

The name of the programming language I will be using is C++.

### When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or need?

Created by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in 1979 (at Bell Laboratories). The name was officially changed from “C with Classes” (based on the C language, 
but with object oriented programming added to language), to C++. He published the reference in 1985 for the language, *The C++ Programming Language*. 
The reason he created the language was because he did his PhD work in Simula, a language considered one of the first object-oriented languages. 
However, the language was slow, which is one reason he wanted to incorporate object oriented programming into the C language, a language that is 
still well-respected for it’s portability without sacrificing speed.

### What types of programming is your language primarily used for?

Because C++ is a general-purpose language, there are many different uses. Some of those include building large software applications, operating systems 
such as Mac OS and Windows, game development, databases, web browsers, and machine learning tools. This list of applications isn't extensive, but these examples
are some of the more popular applications of C++.

### Where will you get information about this language once it is time to start learning it?

Some resources I've found so far include:

- [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/)
- [cplusplus.com](https://www.cplusplus.com/)
- [AspectC++: an aspect-oriented extension to the C++ programming language](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/564092.564100)
- [C++|Encyclopedia of Computer Science](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1074100.1074189)
- [How to teach "modern C++" to someone who already knows programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3160489.3160503)

Some of these sources are online "courses" teaching C++, and others are articles and journals talking about C++> I think these, as well as other papers
that can be found on the ACM website will be helpful in learning the language. 

## Getting Started with C++

### What do you need to do to install the language?

To install the language, I downloaded Eclipse (programming environment) for C/C++.
[Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/kepler/sr2/eclipse-ide-cc-developers)

### Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it? If not, how did you pick the one that you’ll be using?

After trying to install/use C++ in Visual Studio Code, I decided to look around to see what is really recommended for C++. Most of those results 
yielded Eclipse. Eclipse can be used on both Mac OS and Windows, so it is a good choice for compiling and running C++ programs. The instructions
for installing Eclipse are in the link in the previous section.

### How do you run programs in C++?

Using Eclipse, to run a program, you first have to create a new source code file. Then, write the program you would like to run. Once the program is 
finished, you have to “build” the program. This compiles the program before you can run it. In Eclipse, the build button is a paper icon at the top 
of the screen, found under the **Project** menu, or, on a Mac, the shortcut **cmd + B**. Once the program is compiled, then you can run it!

I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW2tWFRqTE) to help set up Eclipse to run C++ programs that is also helpful.

### How do you write comments in C++?

In C++, single line comments can be written by starting the commented line with **//**
Multi-line comments start the first line with a forward-slash (/) and an asterisk (*). The last line then ends with an asterisk and a forward slash.
