# C++: Language History and Getting Started

## History of C++

Created by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in 1979 (at Bell Laboratories). The name was officially changed from “C with Classes” (based on the C language, 
but with object oriented programming added to language), to C++. He published the reference in 1985 for the language, *The C++ Programming Language*. 
The reason he created the language was because he did his PhD work in Simula, a language considered one of the first object-oriented languages. 
However, the language was slow, which is one reason he wanted to incorporate object oriented programming into the C language, a language that is 
still well-respected for it’s portability without sacrificing speed.

C++ is a general-purpose language, so there are many different applications of the language. Some of those include building large software applications, operating systems (although C is more common for OS's), game development, databases, web browsers, and machine learning tools. This list of applications isn't extensive, but these examples are some of the more popular applications of C++.

## Getting Started with C++

Here are some resources/tools to learn C++:
- [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/)
- [cplusplus.com](https://www.cplusplus.com/)
- [AspectC++: an aspect-oriented extension to the C++ programming language](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/564092.564100)
- [C++|Encyclopedia of Computer Science](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1074100.1074189)
- [How to teach "modern C++" to someone who already knows programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3160489.3160503)

Some of these sources are online "courses" teaching C++, and others are articles and journals talking about C++. This list is of course isn't comprehensive, but a good start. There are many other articles and journals etc. on the [ACM](https://www.acm.org/) website. 

To install the language, I downloaded Eclipse (programming environment) for C/C++.
[Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/kepler/sr2/eclipse-ide-cc-developers)

The seemingly highest recommended environment for compiling and running C++ programs is Eclipse. To install Eclipse and C++, follow the directions on this [website](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/kepler/sr2/eclipse-ide-cc-developers). Eclipse can be used on both Mac OS and Windows, so it is a good choice for C++.

### Using Eclipse for C++

In Eclipse, to run a program, you first have to create a new source code file. These files can be created within different projects. Then, write the program you would like to run. Once the program is finished, you have to “build” the program. This compiles the program before you can run it. In Eclipse, the build button is a paper icon at the top of the screen, found under the **Project** menu, or, the shortcut **cmd + B/ctrl + B**. Once the program is compiled, then you can run it!

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW2tWFRqTE) is helpful in setting up Eclipse and running C++ programs.

### Comments in C++

In C++, single line comments can be written by starting the commented line with **//**
Multi-line comments start the first line with a forward-slash (/) and an asterisk (*). The last line then ends with an asterisk and a forward slash.
